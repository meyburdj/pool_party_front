1) add pool form (maybe a yourPools page that has cards of your pools and lets
you add pools) - done
2) add messages modal and figure out how to have it on the pool list
3) add inbox/outbox(which could possibly be all within a user profile dashboard)
4) add dynamic navbar
5) add a pool page(/pools/:pool_id) that shows allthe pictures and has the
information from the cards
7) add reservation function
8) add profile page that has your reservations and pools
9) make version of pool page where buttons redirect to login or signup pages
(landing page. just needs some basic styling)

backend:
1) search feature for text



WISHLIST:
1) figure out the dynamic map stuff
2) add lazy loading for infinite scroll on pools page
3) make a user dashboard where they can use a sidebar to see their pools and reservations and stuff
4) add tests
